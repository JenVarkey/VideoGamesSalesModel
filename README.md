# chart_web_app
This is a documented tutorial on how to make a web application with Python and postgreSQL.

## Before you start
Create a repository

Make sure to make a python gitignore file and in the gitignore file

make a directory called chart_web_app

get the SSH key from the code dropdown and run 

```
git clone <SSH Key>
```
This will make a folder which copies over the gitignore and readme files to your computer.

Download the requirements.txt file and make sure it's in the same folder as the gitignore and readme files.
